Project Outline

1. Start Program (Initial Implementation will be console based)
2. Prompt user for directory to verify
3. Check if current baseline exists (if no baseline exists then this will create the baseline)
4. Recursively list all files and directories within the specified path
5. Record File permissions, name, size, modified date, and hash digest
6. If file attributes have not changed since the last baseline then ignore that file
7. For files that have changed log the changed attributes
8. Take new hash value and query the VT API
9. Report scan results -- Changed files, what attributes changed, and VT query results
